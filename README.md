This is a general-purpose Complaint Management System that allows users to submit complaints across different categories. The system is highly flexible, allowing administrators to add and manage complaint categories according to their needs. It consists of two panels:

1. User Panel: Users can submit their complaints by selecting a relevant category (e.g., technical, service, maintenance). They can provide detailed descriptions, attach supporting documents or images, and track the status of their complaints. Users are also notified when their complaints are resolved or updated.

2. Admin Panel: The admin oversees all the complaints submitted by users. They can categorize, prioritize, and assign complaints to the relevant departments or teams for resolution. The admin can update the complaint status, resolve issues, and communicate with users through the system.

This system provides an organized and efficient way to manage and resolve user complaints, ensuring transparency and accountability in handling various issues.
